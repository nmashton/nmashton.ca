My restless curiosity has pursued me through a variety of different roles.

Lately I've been parenting an energetic baby, settling into North Carolina, and doing technical writing and data visualization development for [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org). In that latter role, I've gained experience developing interactive web graphics in collaboration with investigative journalists.

Just prior to that, I had done four years of computational linguistics research at Cornell University, where I developed a taste for functional programming languages such as Haskell and Clojure.

My present goal is to find a work environment where I can grow as a programmer and a developer. [Download my resumé](./pdf/resume.pdf) to see what I have to offer and [get in touch](mailto:neil.m.ashton@gmail.com).
