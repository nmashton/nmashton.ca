## Professional

My restless curiosity has pursued me through a variety of different roles, giving me a unique range of skills.

I'm currently doing web frontend development on contract for [Caktus Group](http://www.caktusgroup.com). This work builds on my experience developing interactive data visualizations at [Open Knowledge](http://okfn.org), where I also did technical writing and some server-side Python development.

Previously I had studied computational linguistics at Cornell University, where I discovered my love for functional programming languages like Haskell and Clojure. Before that, I was a philologist, studying a wide variety of ancient languages.

## Personal

I'm relatively new to North Carolina, having moved here with my wife [Dr. Becky Butler](http://bckybtlr.com/) and our son Idris last December. I'm originally from Edmonton, but my most recent home was Ithaca.

I'm a member of the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org) and the [NAACP](http://www.naacp.org). My family are Quaker meeting attenders, and we participate in the [Durham Friends Meeting](https://www.quakercloud.org/cloud/durham-friends-meeting).
